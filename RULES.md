Fugitive is a quick 2-player game where one player is the Fugitive moving from hideout to hideout on his escape route, and the other player is the Marshal trying to catch him before he escapes.  

The deck is composed of 43 cards, numbered 0–42, which represent places the Fugitive can hide. 

If the Fugitive is able to play the #42 card, he has managed to get out of town and wins the game. 

If the Marshal uncovers all the Fugitive’s hideouts before he can escape, the Marshal wins.


Setup

Place the 0 card as the Fugitive’s starting point in the center row.  

The Fugitive takes cards numbered 1,2,3, and 42 as his starting hand.  

Sort the cards into three piles: 4­–14, 15–­28, and 29­–41. Shuffle each pile and place it face down. 

The Fugitive draws 3 cards from the 4­–14 pile, 2 cards from the 15-­28 pile and adds them to his hand.

The Marshal starts with no cards.

Game Play

The Fugitive and Marshal alternate turns throughout the game. On the Fugitive’s turn, he may move to a new Hideout as part of his path to escape. On the Marshal’s turn, she attempts to catch the Fugitive by uncovering the Fugitive’s Hideouts. 

Game Turn – Fugitive

Fugitive First Turn:

On his first turn, the Fugitive establishes 2 Hideouts along his escape route in the center row. 

Hideouts: 
To establish a new Hideout, the Fugitive places a card face down to the right of the previous Hideout (or the starting 0 card when beginning the game). 

A newly played Hideout card must be numbered within 1, 2, or 3 of the previous Hideout. The Fugitive cannot backtrack by placing a new Hideout with a lower value than his previous Hideout.

Example: If the last Hideout was the 4, the Fugitive could play either the 5, 6, or 7 card as his next Hideout. 

To span a larger distance and place a Hideout further than 3 away, the Fugitive may Sprint to a new Hideout location.

Sprinting to a Hideout: 
Sprinting allows the next Hideout card to jump more than 3, but it must make up the difference by playing additional cards from his hand and placing them face down under the Hideout card.  Each card has a +1 or +2 in the bottom right corner (All even hideout cards has +2 and all odd hideout cards has +1).  This is how much it adds when used as a Sprint card. 

Example: If the last Hideout was the 4 and the Fugitive wanted to next play the 10 as a new Hideout, he would have to add +3 worth of cards underneath the 10. The normal movement would allow him to go from the 4 up to 7. Since 10 is 3 more than 7, he will need to Sprint +3. 

The Fugitive can “overpay” for a Sprint, putting down more than necessary, even when none is needed.  

 
After the Fugitive has placed his initial two Hideouts, his first turn is over and play proceeds to the Marshal. 

Fugitive Normal Turn:

At the start of each Fugitive turn after his first, he draws 1 card from any of the three decks and adds it to his hand. 

The Fugitive may then establish 1 new Hideout by placing a card face down to the right of his last Hideout. He may also Sprint to this new Hideout as described above. 

The Fugitive isn’t required to place a new Hideout each turn. He can just say “Pass”.

The Fugitive can also peek at his face down Hideout and Sprint cards along his route at any time.


Game Turn – Marshal

Marshal First Turn:

On her first turn, the Marshal draws 2 cards from any of the decks and adds them to her hand. 

She then can try to uncover the Fugitive Hideouts. 

Uncovering Hideouts:
To try to uncover a Fugitive Hideout, the Marshal guesses a number.

If that number is any of the face down Hideouts, it is uncovered; the Fugitive flips the matching Hideout card face up. If there were any Sprint cards under the Hideout, those are revealed.  Remember that you don’t need to point to a card when guessing—it will be revealed if it matches any hideout, even the most recent one.

If her guess is incorrect, nothing is revealed.

Instead of a single guess, the Marshal can attempt to uncover more than one Hideout on her turn. To do so, she must guess multiple numbers at once. If ALL of the guessed numbers are face down Hideouts, the Fugitive reveals them and any Sprint cards underneath. But if even one of those numbers is not a face down Hideout, nothing is revealed; the Fugitive just says you are incorrect.

Sprint cards are not guessed.

After attempting to uncover a Hideout, whether successful or not, the Marshal’s turn is over and play continues with the Fugitive’s turn.

Marshal Normal Turn:

At the start of each Marshal turn, she draws 1 card from any of the three decks and adds it to her hand.

She may then attempt to uncover the Fugitive Hideouts.


Game End

The game ends in one of two ways: 

The Fugitive has played the #42 card → Fugitive Wins
The Marshal has uncovered all existing Fugitive Hideouts → Marshal Wins

Manhunt
If the Fugitive is far ahead of the Marshal, there is a last-­ditch option. If the Fugitive plays the #42 card, but the highest revealed hideout is less than 30, the Marshal gets a final chance to uncover the Hideouts. This is the Manhunt. She starts making single number guesses, each one being resolved before the next. She can keep guessing until she is incorrect, at which point the Fugitive escapes (and wins). But if she guesses all of the hideouts, she catches him at the last second.


Game Play Variants
Events
At the start of the game, shuffle 2 random event cards into each of the three draw piles. When a player draws an event, they resolve it immediately. Most events will affect both players and will usually have you draw another card.


Strategies and Tips

Being a good Fugitive requires taking risks. The Marshal must methodically search and deduce where the Fugitive might be. Here are a few strategies and tips for each side. 

Fugitive Strategy:
You don’t always have to play a Hideout. Sometimes it’s best to wait for better cards.
Sprinting too often as the Fugitive can use up too many cards, often making you wait for a good draw.
Don't bluff too often, even if it does keep the Marshall guessing.
Drawing from a higher pile than you need can throw off the Marshal and help you later in the game.
Playing a Hideout number that the Marshal just guessed is great as she’s not likely to guess it again.

Marshal Strategy:
It’s recommended to take notes to remember what you’ve guessed.
When guessing a hideout with two Sprint cards, there is a 50% chance the total Sprint value is +3.
Don’t guess more than one number very often. It can leave you further behind instead of catching up. However, if you are certain about one Hideout, then guess it along with another number.
Sometimes drawing exclusively from a higher pile can create a “roadblock” that is harder for the Fugitive to get around.
Jumping ahead and guessing a higher Hideout can give you Sprint cards that help guess the hideouts before it. Sometimes you can “count” backwards with the revealed Sprint cards to determine the Hideout right before it.
Pay attention to the cards the Fugitive looks at when checking a guess. Also watch which pile he draws from. Information is everywhere.
